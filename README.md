Great question — and yes, you’re absolutely right to pause and ask:

> Should we build UI + basic APIs first, or set up authentication first?

## 🧭 Recommended Step-by-Step Roadmap (with reasoning)

### ✅ Phase 1: **Core Setup**

These are things you do once and use throughout:

1. ✅ Set up project folder with App Router
2. ✅ Set up TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui
3. ✅ Configure Prisma with PostgreSQL
4. ✅ Create `lib/prisma.ts` (✅ done)
5. ✅ Test query route like `/api/docs` (✅ done)

---

### ✅ Phase 2: **Authentication Setup**

**Do this early** because:

* You’ll want all dashboard logic (uploads, summaries, notes) to be **user-specific**
* If you delay auth, you’ll have to rewrite logic later to support logged-in users

So:
6\. 🔐 Add NextAuth with Google login
7\. 🔐 Sync `User` model in DB
8\. 🔐 Protect dashboard routes (only visible to logged-in users)

---

### ✅ Phase 3: **Basic UI + API**

After auth is done:
9\. 🧩 Build `/dashboard` UI
10\. 📁 Add Upload component (`FileUploader.tsx`)
11\. 🧠 Add `/api/upload.ts` endpoint (store file URL in DB)
12\. 🤖 Add `/api/summarize.ts` to call OpenAI and save summary

---

### ✅ Phase 4: **Document Details Page**

13. 🗂️ `dashboard/[docId]/page.tsx` → show file summary + notes
14. 📝 Add `NotesEditor.tsx` to view + write notes

---

### ✅ Phase 5: **Enhancements**

15. 🔗 Add sharing logic (SharedAccess model)
16. 🧠 Add chat feature with AI for each doc
17. 📦 Add file preview or download

---

## ✅ So What Should We Do *Now*?

You're at the **perfect point to do authentication** next. Here’s why:

* Your DB is ready
* You’ve tested Prisma queries
* You’ll want user IDs for uploaded files
